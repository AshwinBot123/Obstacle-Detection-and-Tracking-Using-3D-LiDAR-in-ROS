This project implements real-time obstacle detection and tracking using 3D LiDAR, IMU, and odometry data. The node processes point clouds with DBSCAN to identify and cluster obstacles, calculates their positions and velocities in the global frame, and predicts future movements for dynamic obstacles. It uses the Hungarian algorithm for obstacle matching, adaptive velocity smoothing for tracking, and visualizes results in RViz with markers for bounding boxes, velocities, and future positions. Detailed obstacle data, including predictions, is published in JSON format for downstream processing. This solution is ideal for applications in autonomous navigation, UAV obstacle avoidance, and real-time 3D perception systems.
